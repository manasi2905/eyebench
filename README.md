![EyeBench Overview](./docs/figures/eyebench_overview.png)
*Figure 1: Overview of EyeBench v1.0. The benchmark curates multiple datasets for predicting reader properties (👩), and reader–text interactions (👩+📝) from eye movements. ⭐ marks prediction tasks newly introduced in EyeBench. The data are preprocessed and standardized into aligned text and gaze sequences, which are then used as input to models trained to predict task-specific targets. The models are systematically evaluated under three generalization regimes — unseen readers, unseen texts, or both. The benchmark supports the evaluation and addition of new models, datasets, and tasks.*

## 🧠 Introduction

**EyeBench** is the first benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning models that decode cognitive and linguistic information from eye movements during reading.  
It provides a standardized, extensible framework for **predictive modeling from eye tracking data**, aiming to bridge **cognitive science and multimodal AI**.

EyeBench curates multiple publicly available datasets and tasks, covering both **reader properties** and **reader–text interactions**, and includes **baselines**, **state-of-the-art models**, and **evaluation protocols** that ensure reproducibility and comparability across studies.

Progress on EyeBench is expected to advance both **scientific understanding of human language processing** and **practical applications** such as adaptive educational systems and cognitive-aware user interfaces.

## 📚 Tasks and Datasets

EyeBench v1.0 includes **seven prediction tasks** spanning **six harmonized datasets**.  
Each task is formulated as a **single-trial prediction problem** from a reader’s eye movements while reading a passage (and optionally an auxiliary text, such as a question or claim).

## 🧩 Implemented Models and Baselines

EyeBench provides **12 implemented models** and **6 baselines**, unified under a shared training and evaluation framework.

### Neural Models

## 🧮 Evaluation Protocol

EyeBench evaluates models under **three complementary generalization regimes**:

| Regime | Description | Typical Use Case |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Unseen Reader** | Texts seen, readers unseen | New readers, known materials |
| **Unseen Text** | Readers seen, texts unseen | Personalized reading of new content |
| **Unseen Reader & Text** | Both unseen | Fully general setting |

### Metrics

- **Classification:** AUROC, Balanced Accuracy  
- **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, R²  
- **Aggregate:** Average Normalized Score and Mean Rank across all task–dataset pairs.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EyeBench/eyebench.git
cd eyebench
mamba env create -f environment.yml
conda activate eyebench
```

On Apple Silicon macOS, use the CPU/MPS-compatible environment without CUDA:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.macos.yml
conda activate eyebench
```

### 2. Download and Preprocess Data

```bash
bash src/data/preprocessing/get_data.sh
```

This script downloads, harmonizes, and creates standardized folds for all datasets under `data/processed/`.

### 3. Log into Weights & Biases (WandB)

```bash
wandb login
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Train a Model

```bash
python src/run/single_run/train.py +trainer=TrainerDL +model=RoberteyeWord +data=OneStop_RC
```

Train the tuned, leakage-safe two-layer stacking ensemble for PoTeC domain
expertise using the four proposal features:

```bash
WANDB_MODE=offline python src/run/single_run/train.py \
  +trainer=TrainerML \
  +model=StackingEnsembleMLArgs \
  +data=PoTeC_DE \
  data.fold_index=0
```

The base layer contains Logistic Regression, KNN, RBF-SVM, and Random Forest.
Every base model is tuned inside participant-grouped cross-fitting folds;
SVM and Random Forest probabilities are sigmoid-calibrated on group-safe
splits. The second Logistic Regression is tuned with L1/L2 regularization on
the four out-of-fold probability columns.

Run all four PoTeC folds for both the four-feature model and the controlled
reading-speed ablation:

```bash
python src/run/single_run/run_stacking_cv.py
```

Results are written to `results/stacking_potec_de_tuned/`. They include base
and ensemble AUROC, probability correlations, selected validation thresholds,
per-fold predictions, and the exact selected hyperparameters. Threshold
tuning affects accuracy metrics only; AUROC is always calculated from the raw
probabilities.

Run the heterogeneous tabular stack, where each base receives its own feature
view and reading speed is a separate fifth base:

```bash
python src/run/single_run/run_stacking_cv.py \
  --feature-sets heterogeneous
```

Fuse those five held-out predictions with an existing neural model and compare
the retained Logistic Regression meta-learner with the tiny MLP ablation:

```bash
# RoBERTEye-F
python src/run/single_run/run_neural_late_fusion.py

# PLM-AS-RM
python src/run/single_run/run_neural_late_fusion.py \
  --neural-model PLMASfArgs

python src/run/single_run/summarize_stacking_experiments.py
```

Neural late fusion trains the meta-learner only on held-out validation
predictions and evaluates it on test predictions. The report-ready comparison
is saved under `results/stacking_potec_de_report/`.

### Run a Hyperparameter Sweep

```bash
bash run_commands/utils/sweep_wrapper.sh --data_tasks CopCo_TYP --folds 0,1,2,3 --cuda 0,1
```

### Test a Model

```bash
python src/run/single_run/test_dl.py +model=RoberteyeWord +data=OneStop_RC
```

Results are stored under:
`
results/raw/{data_model_trainer_task}/fold_index={i}/trial_level_test_results.csv
results/eyebench_benchmark_results/{metric}.csv
`

## 🧠 Adding a New Model

1. Create a file under `src/models/YourModel.py` inheriting from `BaseModel`.
   Implement `forward()` and `shared_step()` methods.
2. Register it in:

    - `src/configs/constants.py` → `DLModelNames` (or `MLModelNames` for ML models)
    - `src/configs/models/dl/YourModel.py` → model config class decorated with `@register_model_config` (use `src/configs/models/ml/` for ML models)

3. Define its default parameters and search space in `src/run/multi_run/search_spaces.py`.
4. Verify integration:

```bash
bash run_commands/utils/model_checker.sh
```

---

## 📊 Adding a New Dataset

1. Store raw or preprocessed data in `data/YOUR_DATASET/`.
2. Define its loading logic in `src/data/datasets/YOUR_DATASET.py` (inherits from `ETDataset`).
3. Add preprocessing logic under `src/data/preprocessing/dataset_preprocessing/YOUR_DATASET.py`.
4. Register the dataset in `src/configs/data.py` and `src/configs/constants.py`.
5. Add a corresponding task configuration class if it supports multiple tasks.

Datasets must comply with EyeBench’s selection criteria:

- Passage-level texts
- ≥ 500 Hz sampling rate
- Publicly available raw or fixation-level data
- Released texts and gaze–text alignment
